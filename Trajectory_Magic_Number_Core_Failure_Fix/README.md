Gromacs Trajectory Fix
Originally written in: GNU bash, version 4.1.2(1)-release (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu)

Description:
This script will be useful if you have multiple magic numbers and/or core failures in your
trajectory due to supercomputer failures/hiccups.

File Preparation:
1. Change the "Load Gromacs" section to your own version if needed.
2. Change the prefix and suffix  under the "Version control of gromacs commands" to your own version if needed.

Example:
./xtcfix.sh [trajectory in] [trajectory out name] [part number (optional)]
./xtcfix.sh md.xtc segment.xtc
Use option "b" to test for beginning time frames and "e" to finish off (the start time frame will be remembered)
